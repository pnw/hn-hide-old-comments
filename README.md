# hn-hide-old-comments
A simple Chrome browser extention that allows you to automatically
collapse old comment threads when you revisit an interesting discussion.

It injects a small form to the top of a discussion thread which allows
you to bulk-collapse all comment trees that don't have a comment
newer than the selected time.
